# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~
t = ('a', 'b', 'n', 5, 8, 10)
if 'n' in t and 8 in t:
    print("'n' and 8 both exist in the tuple.")
else:
    print("Either 'n' or 8 or both do not exist in the tuple.")
~~~
